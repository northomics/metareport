## Charge States

<details>
  <summary>Why charge state?</summary>
  
1. Peptide Charge distribution is a good sign of trypsin digestion and electric spray ionization.


  * In a typical ESI analysis of trytic digest, most of the peptides should have 2 charges, less peptides have 3 charges, because tryptic peptides have a lysine/arginie at the C-terminal, along with N-terminal contributing another charge. A possible miscleavage will contribute the third charge. 
  
  
  * In the ESI procedure, peptides with 2 and more charges are easier to fragment and then identified by MS. However, too many charges will make the m/z of the peptides too small to escape the scan range, further more, it will also complicate the ms2 spectra. 

2. if you see more peptides with charge 3 than charge 2 state


  *  It might indicate in-sufficient trypsin digesion, check the percentage of peptides with miss-cleavage site. 
  
  *  It might indicate the ESI is not sufficient/good enough.Check the distance between the ESI tip and MS oriface, if the ESI tip is dirty, if there is droplet occasionally.

## Length


<details>
  <summary>Why peptide length do you expect?</summary>
  
  * Averge length of tryptic peptide is around 10. 
  * refer to this page for peptide length.

## Score

<details>
  <summary>Why peptide score do you expect?</summary>
  
  * The average score should be around 50

df_score <- data.frame(Score  = peptide_tidyed$score)


ggplot2::ggplot(data=df_score, aes(Score)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),color= "black",fill="white")+

## Sparsity/Presence


* The more peptide of 100% presence the better quality of the data

***

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.width= 8,fig.height=6}

df_sparsity <- as.data.frame(table(sparsity))
df_sparsity_dec <- df_sparsity[order(df_sparsity$sparsity,decreasing = TRUE),]
df_sparsity_dec$sparsity <- factor(df_sparsity_dec$sparsity, levels = df_sparsity_dec$sparsity)


ggplot2::ggplot(data = df_sparsity_dec)+
  geom_col(aes(x = sparsity,y = Freq))+
  labs(title = "Sparsity Distribution", x = "Number of Presence",y = "Frequency") + 
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        panel.grid = element_blank())

```


* Figure shows how many peptides have more than N presence, which helps to set the presence cutoff

```{r Sparsicty distribution plot, echo=FALSE,fig.width= 8,fig.height=6}


#df_sparsity_dec <- df_sparsity[order(df_sparsity$sparsity,decreasing = TRUE),]

df_sparsity_dec$cumsum <-  cumsum(df_sparsity_dec$Freq)

# redefine the sparisty sequence, in order to keep the order in the plot, This is the best way as far as I know
#df_sparsity_dec$sparsity <- factor(df_sparsity_dec$sparsity, levels = df_sparsity_dec$sparsity)


ggplot2::ggplot(data = df_sparsity_dec)+
  geom_col(aes(x = sparsity,y = cumsum))+
  labs(title = "Sparsity Distribution", x = "Number of Presence",y = "Frequency") + 
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        panel.grid = element_blank())



```


## Intensity
 
```{r Peptide Inenisty distribution plot, echo=FALSE,fig.width= 8,fig.height=figure_height}

#note: in this log10 intenisty matrix, 0 is converted into infinity, therefore will not show in the box plot, and does not affect the distribution

data_matrix_log10_melt<-reshape2::melt(as.matrix(log10(peptide_tidyed$intensity_matrix)))

colnames(data_matrix_log10_melt) <- c("Proteins", "Samples", "Log10(Inensity)")

ggplot(data_matrix_log10_melt)+
    geom_violin(aes(x = Samples, y = `Log10(Inensity)`)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = Samples, y = `Log10(Inensity)`),width=0.2) +
    labs(title = "Peptide Intensity Distribution", x = "",y = "log10(Intensity)") + 
    theme_bw()+
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        panel.grid = element_blank())+
    coord_flip()
